# AI Trading Signal Bot (Termux + Web Dashboard)

A pure-Python crypto trading signal bot that analyzes Binance market data with
10 strategies and serves a live charting dashboard on your phone's local IP.

Built on **aiohttp + WebSocket** for realtime updates: live trade ticks move
the last candle and the price with smooth animation, klines stream in as they
form, and analysis snapshots / signals push instantly to every connected
browser. No numpy / pandas — only `aiohttp`, `websockets` and
`requests`, so it installs cleanly on Termux.

## Strategies (confluence scored)

| Strategy | What it detects |
| --- | --- |
| EMA 7/25/99 | Trend stack alignment, fresh 7/25 crosses |
| Support / Resistance | Clustered swing levels, bounces, breakouts |
| Trendlines | Regression-fit trendlines, bounces and breaks |
| Chart Patterns | Engulfing, pin bars, double top/bottom, head & shoulders |
| Fibonacci | Retracement of dominant swing (0.5 / 0.618 golden zone) |
| Smart Money Concepts | BOS / CHoCH, order blocks, fair value gaps |
| Liquidity Sweeps | Stop hunts through equal highs/lows that reverse |
| Orderflow / CVD | Delta pressure, CVD divergence, absorption |
| Auction Market | Volume profile POC, value area acceptance/rejection |
| Fundamentals | Funding rate, open interest, long/short ratio |

Each strategy votes -1..+1 and is weighted (see `config.py`). A LONG/SHORT
signal fires when the composite score crosses the threshold (default 45/100),
together with an ATR-based trade plan (entry / stop / TP1 / TP2).

## Install on Termux

```bash
pkg update && pkg install python git
git clone <your-repo-url> signal-bot && cd signal-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

The console prints your local network URL, e.g.:

```
  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:8000
  Network: http://192.168.1.23:8000
```

Open the Network URL from any browser on the same Wi-Fi (or the Local URL on
the phone itself). To keep it running with the screen off, run
`termux-wake-lock` first.

## Configuration

Edit `config.py`:

- `SYMBOLS`, `INTERVALS` — markets offered in the dashboard dropdowns
- `WEIGHTS` — importance of each strategy in the composite score
- `SIGNAL_THRESHOLD` — how much confluence is needed to fire a signal
- `REFRESH_SECONDS` — background analysis interval
- `PORT` — web server port

Signal history persists to `signals.json`.

> Note: if `api.binance.com` is geo-restricted where you are, the bot
> automatically falls back to `data-api.binance.vision` for market data.
> Futures fundamentals (funding/OI) are skipped gracefully when unavailable.

## AI market intelligence pipeline (Groq)

`ai_analyst.py` is not a single model call — it's a pipeline that only lets a
trade idea through if every stage agrees it's worth publishing:

```
Market data (engine.py, all 10 strategies)
    -> Market regime filter (market_regime.py)      -- skip AI in chop/spikes
    -> Structural trade-quality pre-check (trade_quality.py)
    -> Signal memory context (signal_memory.py)      -- past similar setups
    -> Primary AI analyst (Groq)                     -- forms the thesis
    -> Server-side risk gate                         -- re-checks the math
    -> Final trade-quality grade on the actual plan
    -> AI critic (Groq, second opinion)              -- tries to kill it
    -> Signal memory write
```

Every stage after the primary analyst can only make the call **more**
conservative (push it toward WAIT) — none of them can invent or upgrade a
signal. The system is tuned to prefer no trade over a low-quality one.

**1. Market regime filter** (`market_regime.py`) — classifies the market as
`trending_bullish` / `trending_bearish` / `range` / `accumulation` /
`distribution` / `high_volatility` / `mixed` using the engine's own SMC trend
and composite score, plus range-compression and volatility-expansion ratios
computed from the same candles (no extra network calls). When it flags the
market as non-tradeable, **the Groq call is skipped entirely** and the result
is WAIT with the regime's reasons — this is what keeps AI usage down during
poor conditions instead of just generating more WAIT calls from the model.

**2. Trade quality engine** (`trade_quality.py`) — grades a setup **A+ / A /
B / Reject** instead of a blended confluence number. Location, structure,
liquidity, order-flow and risk are rated independently (e.g. location asks
"is price actually at an order block / FVG / S-R level?", not "what's the
score?"). It runs once before the AI call (structural context) and again on
the AI's actual entry/stop/tp1 to decide whether the call is good enough to
publish (`config.AI_MIN_TRADE_GRADE`, default `B`).

**3. Signal memory** (`signal_memory.py`) — a local SQLite log
(`signal_history.db`, gitignored) of every published call: symbol,
timestamp, setup type, entry/stop/target, market condition, quality grade
and the AI's own reasoning. The last few setups on the same symbol are fed
back into the AI's context window and turned into an explicit risk warning
if recent similar trades lost.

**4. Primary AI analyst** — receives the full 1h confluence read, an
explicit liquidity/structure summary (sweeps, resting liquidity pools,
BOS/CHoCH events, CVD divergence), a 4h higher-timeframe summary, the regime
classification, the structural quality grade, recent similar setups and any
risk warnings. Its default answer is **WAIT**; it only calls LONG/SHORT with
a thesis, a clean location, a concrete confirmation, a logical invalidation,
and a reward/risk of at least 1.8.

**5. Server-side risk gate** — never trusts the model's self-reported
numbers. It re-derives risk/reward and entry-to-price distance from the
actual entry/stop/tp1, and additionally rejects the call if the stop sits on
a resting liquidity pool (stop-hunt risk), an opposing support/resistance
level sits between entry and tp1 (unrealistic target), or the regime is
flagged high-volatility. Any rejection sets `gated: true` with a
human-readable `gate_reason` and forces `signal: "WAIT"`.

**6. AI critic** (`config.AI_CRITIC_ENABLED`, default on) — a second,
independent Groq call that is instructed to be skeptical by default and try
to kill the trade: is the entry late, is there liquidity/structure against
it before target, is the reward/risk realistic given the real price
distances, could this be a trap, does the higher timeframe disagree. If it
doesn't approve, the call is forced to WAIT with the critic's critique
attached (`result.critic`).

### Setup

Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in the environment (or a local `.env` file next to
`server.py` — handy on Termux). Without it the AI layer is disabled and the
dashboard falls back to the raw engine signals. `GROQ_MODEL` overrides the
default model (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, with automatic fallback to other
Groq models on rate limits/outages).

### Tunables (`config.py`)

- `AI_INTERVAL` / `AI_HTF_INTERVAL` — primary chart + higher-timeframe context
- `AI_REFRESH_SECONDS` — poll cadence per active symbol
- `REGIME_COMPRESSION_TIGHT` / `REGIME_VOLATILITY_SPIKE` — regime filter thresholds
- `AI_MIN_RISK_REWARD` / `AI_MAX_ENTRY_ATR_DISTANCE` — risk gate thresholds
- `AI_MIN_TRADE_GRADE` — minimum trade-quality grade required to publish
- `AI_CRITIC_ENABLED` — toggle the second-pass critic review
- `SIGNAL_MEMORY_LOOKBACK` — how many past setups are shown to the AI

### Output

`GET /api/ai?symbol=BTCUSDT` returns the latest cached call; the dashboard
also receives live `{"type":"ai", ...}` pushes over the websocket. Result
